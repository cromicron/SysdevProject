<h3>Project for The Course System Development for the Master Degree in Data Science @ Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t Munich</h3>
<pr>In this project, a backend for a routing service is implemented in Java. The routing service takes in coordinates from a Node-JS-UI, calculates the shortest path between the two coordinates, and returns a JSON-Object to the UI, which then displays the route on an interactive map. The algorithms to be implemented are Dijkstras shortest path and A*.</pr>
